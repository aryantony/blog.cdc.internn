                Hey CDC folks, I know the road ahead might look hard. But believe in your effort – it will pay off. If
                you're not from a circuit background and don't get picked by a company right away, don't get
                discouraged. Your hard work won't go unseen. Every day, you'll see the results of your determination.
                Even I didn’t get any shortlisted in day-1 companies. I was quite frustrated with the way the
                shortlisting criteria were being used for some day-1 companies where I did 100% in tests. Oracle was the
                only company that I got shortlisted for day-2. So, 1 shortlist and 1 chance of an interview will be
                sufficient if you did hard work.

                1. Brief Introduction
            </h3>
            <p class="ans">
                I am Aryan Kumar, an undergraduate student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department,
                pursuing
                a dual degree course. I sat for the CDC Internship drive and will have my internship in the Software
                Development role at Oracle. I’m a boarder of JCB Hall.
            </p>

        <div class="borderqans">
            <h3 class="question">
                2. How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?
            </h3>
            <p class="ans">
                <b class="bd">Coding Round</b>: The first stage was a 90-min online coding test. The test comprised 2
                coding
                questions and 20 MCQs. I would estimate the coding question complexity to be medium to hard leetcode but
                both are tricky and MCQs are normally based on puzzles and code snippets. I did quite well in the test
                —100% of test cases passed for both questions and was moderately confident about expecting a shortlist.
                </br> </br>
                <b class="bd">Shortlisting Criteria</b>: Shortlists were announced based on test performance. If you did
                all
                questions of the test then you might be shortlisted based on department or CGPA.
                </br> </br>
                <b class="bd">Interview</b>: Oracle comes with a total of 8 people, having 6 interviewers and 2 HR. All
                interview round
                was offline. All the round of interview was 1-1. I was the only person who had been shortlisted from the
                non-circuital department, that’s why I had 3-technical rounds and 1-HR rounds but circuital people have
                only 2-technical and 1-HR rounds.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 1</b>: I was a bit confused at the beginning when I had to introduce myself because
                I felt really
                nervous. This was my first time having a one-on-one interview in person, which made things even harder.
                As a result, I had trouble speaking clearly because I was unsure of myself. Thankfully, the interviewer
                kindly offered me some water, which gave me a short break and helped me calm down. After that, being in
                the interviewer's friendly presence made me feel more comfortable.
                To assess my technical acumen, I was provided with a pen and a set of A4-sized sheets to transcribe the
                code from the '#include' statement to the 'return 0' statement within the main function. It's noteworthy
                that I was not allowed to utilize function snippets, a caveat unique to my circumstance as someone with
                a non-circuit background.
                During our talk, the interviewer asked me questions based on <b>binary trees, using trees in dynamic
                    programming, and topological sorting</b>. They also wanted to know about my past internships. What
                made it
                interesting was that I had to figure out and write the solutions for these coding problems on paper
                right then and there. I'd never done that before, so it was quite tough. But as we continued talking and
                I got more comfortable with the interviewer, my nervousness started to fade away. It was surprising how
                smoothly this happened, and I found it easier to handle the challenges that came up.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 2</b>: This round was the same as the previous one, I had to write the coding
                question’s answer on
                paper. This round was a bit tough than the previous one where all the question was standard type like
                <b>finding the sum in the range of each query using segment tree, knapsack dp with binary search, and
                    standard bitmask dp(leetcode hard problem)</b>. Writing each question’s code from scratch was the
                only
                difficult part of this round. The interviewer also asked me more about my CV and my college courses. It
                was like they were asking me to explain what I had done before.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 3</b>: This round was completely harder of all. I would estimate the question
                complexity to span
                1400–1600 Codeforces ratings or so, the questions were definitely of a slightly higher level than the
                average CDC coding interviews that season. All questions need attention.
                </br>
                <b>“All these three rounds had taken around 60-70 minutes each. So having patience is required.”</b>
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 4 [HR]</b>: My starting question was “In my world of computer science, how can I
                help some
                non-circuital guy”. I answered gently and shared my experience in three internships in web development
                along with what I learned from them. He seemed pleased with my response. I also mentioned that I'm good
                at OOPs (which stands for Object-Oriented Programming). After all the technical questions, he asked
                about my day and the company. We had a casual chat that lasted around 25-30 minutes.

                3. How to prepare for them?
            </h3>
            <p class="ans">
                “Here are some ideas to help you prepare for interviews at software companies on day-1 and day-2. Please
                follow these tips”
                </br></br>
                <b class="bd">~</b> During your winter vacation (December), take a course called Algozenth - 201. If
                you're new to
                programming concepts like the 'printf' statement in the C language, start from scratch and build your
                foundation in this one month. Even if you've taken the course before, it's a good way to reinforce your
                skills.
                </br></br>
                <b class="bd">~</b> During the summer vacation, which is around 60-80 days, start working on LeetCode
                problems once
                you've completed about 40-50% of the Algozenith 201 courses. Focus on dynamic programming and
                graph-related problems. Aim to solve at least 100-150 (dp + graph) LeetCode questions to become
                proficient."Before watching the DP and graph videos from Algozenith, make sure to watch the videos on
                YouTube by 'Strive' for both DP and graphs (highly recommended)."
                </br></br>
                <b class="bd">~</b> As you complete around 20% of the Algozenith course, begin participating in the ABC
                contest (AtCoder
                Beginner Contest) held every Saturday at 5:30 PM. The first four questions are relatively easier, while
                the last four require more attention. If you can't solve a problem during the contest, try working on it
                after the contest (**very important).
                </br></br>
                <b class="bd">~</b> In the final weeks leading up to interviews, learn Computer Science concepts related
                to
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). Watch lectures 6 to 18 of the 'C++ by Saurabh Shukla' series and
                practice all the OOPs questions on InterviewBit (there are about 50 multiple-choice questions). If you
                have time, you can also explore subjects like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (DBMS), and Networking
                for additional knowledge.
                </br>
                <b>“Having a strong grasp of CS fundamentals, especially OOPs, is crucial."</b>

                4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this

            </h3>
            <p class="ans">
                I didn't face many problems, but I noticed that many people started preparing late. Due to this, they
                were still polishing their CP skills during the tests instead of targeted interview prep which that time
                should ideally be reserved for. So, it's best to follow the recommended early preparation, which should
                be enough for people with average skills.
